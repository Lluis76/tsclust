It is often high dimensional, and not iid.  This package hopes to provide a suite of clustering algorithms, in hopes that one works for your data!  tsclust is currently not available on CRAN and is still in major development.\r\n\r\n## Clustering techniques\r\n\r\n### K-means\r\nStandard k-means\r\n\r\n### Hierarchical Clustering\r\nhclust using correlation distance, euclidean distance, DTW, ...\r\n\r\n### Extrema Clustering\r\nClustering based on when local extrema occur\r\n\r\n### Frequency Domain Clustering\r\nClustering based on the smoothed periodogram\r\n\r\n### [Jure Leskovec Clustering](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/memeshapes-wsdm11.pdf)\r\n\r\n### Clustering using Change of Basis\r\nNMF and/or [Principal Dynamical Components](http://math.nyu.edu/faculty/tabak/publications/DPCcpam.pdf)","name":"Tsclust"}
